# Proves the required-clause check can fail, and that it fails for the right
# reason.
#
# Every assertion is on the MESSAGE, and on the exact exit status beside it.
# This check has several separate ways of refusing — a clause gone from a file,
# a file gone from the tree, a file never tracked, an unreadable file, a
# manifest that is missing, empty or malformed — and one bit cannot tell them
# apart. A run where all but one of those branches works would otherwise be
# indistinguishable from a run where all of them work.
#
# The check resolves its manifest next to its own source, so every case below
# runs a COPY in a scratch directory. Writing the fixtures next to the real
# script would mean editing a tracked file in this repository and trusting a
# restore step to put it back.
